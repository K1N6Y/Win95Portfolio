# Win95 Portfolio

This project uses the [react95](https://github.com/arturbien/React95) component library to mimic the classic Windows 95 interface.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

Create an optimized production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the built app locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

You can customize the portfolio content by editing the placeholder sections in the React components.
